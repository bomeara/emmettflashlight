# emmettflashlight
Code for a color changing flashlight; fork from Dan Rasmussen, dan@retro-tronics.com. 

The instructions come from http://makezine.com/projects/million-color-hsl-flashlight/ . We are using a Trinket Pro 5V instead of the Arduino Pro Mini used in the initial build; we may also be using fewer potentiometers.

This is work done by Naomi O'Meara (age 9) and Brian (age 36). It's a Christmas (2015) present for her brother, Emmett (age 6) [if you are reading this before Dec. 25, 2015, don't tell him!].
