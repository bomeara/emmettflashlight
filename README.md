This is work done by Naomi O'Meara (age 9) and Brian (age 36) as part of a build for a color changing flashlight for Emmett (age 6). If you are reading this before Dec. 25, 2015, don't tell him!

The instructions and most of the code come from [Dan Rasmussen](http://makezine.com/author/dan-rasmussen/) on [Make Magazine](http://makezine.com/projects/million-color-hsl-flashlight/) . We are using a [Trinket Pro 5V](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-pro-trinket) instead of the Arduino Pro Mini used in the initial build. We're also using a rotary encoder rather than a 10 position switch; to deal with this, we have incorporated some code from [bildr](http://bildr.org/2012/08/rotary-encoder-arduino/). We are making additional modifications in this fork. 

This is our first real Arduino-compatible project.
